Setup
To use this, copy contents of src folder to your web server root (assuming you have LAMP, WAMP or MAMP setup. if not, do it first.)
You have to create a MySQL user named 'user' and password 'password' (which you can change in php files in src)
To do this, run mysql server in a command line shell and enter following SQL:
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
You also have to create a database named login and a table named list by entering following SQL commands:
CREATE DATABASE login;
USE login;
CREATE TABLE list (
    id int not null auto_increment,
    user_name varchar(255) not null,
    first_name varchar(255) not null,
    last_name varchar(255) not null,
    email varchar(255) not null,
    password varchar(255) not null,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
